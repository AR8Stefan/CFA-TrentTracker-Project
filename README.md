# CFA Group Project -- Trent Tracker

##About The Project

Trent has become a celebrity in the Philippines. All celebrities of note have legions of adoring groupies.

Our project aims to solve the question -- as a fan, where is Trent today?, and how can I show my devotion to him?

### Design Criteria

We used the following user stories to design our application:

** User stories **
* As a Trent Lover I want to be able to select artists and songs to make a playlist and send to Trent.
* As a Trent lover I want a song based his location so I can set the mood.
* As a Trent lover I want to know the exact street address of where he is now or where he has been.
* As a Trent Lover I want to be able to enter my location and see how far away I am from Trent.
* As a Trent Lover I want to be able to send him email through the internet.

##Installation & How To Run

The app runs in the terminal. Run:

`ruby TrentTracker.rb`

##How to use

The first to display is the splash screen informing to the user what the app is for. Press any key to go onto the selection screen. There are 3 items to choose from 1) find out Trent's location, 2) send a mix tape to Trent based on his geographical location, 3) send a love letter to trent via the inbuilt email interface.
